    "# WeGo Public Transit\n",
    "[WeGo Public Transit](https://www.wegotransit.com/) is a public transit system serving the Greater Nashville and Davidson County area. WeGo provides local and regional bus routes, the WeGo Star train service connecting Lebanon to downtown Nashville, along with several other transit services.\n",

    "In this project, you'll be analyzing the bus spacing to look for patterns and try to identify correlations to controllable or external factors. Specifically, you'll be using a dataset containing information on the headway, or amount of time between vehicle arrivals at a stop. This dataset contains a column HDWY_DEV, which shows the headway deviation. This variable will be negative when bunching has occurred (shorter headway than scheduled) and will be positive for gapping (longer headway than scheduled). Note that you can calculate headway deviation percentage as HDWY_DEV/SCHEDULED_HDWY."
